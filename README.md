- 👋 Hi, I’m @stackdev-web.
- 👀 I love to code! I took a long break from it to work in Education but am now finally back to my first passion - software engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning through a boot camp called Lambda School. I hope to be up and running by the end of February 2022.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that can use my assistance. I am ALWAYS looking to learn something new.
- 📫 You can reach me through my about page at about.com/roxanneweber. I look forward to hearing from you!
